Decrementing function - used with loops
- map set of program variables to an integer
- start with non-negative value
- loop terminates when value <= 0
- decreased each time through the loop

Back to cube root function - decrementing function is:
x = 8
--> abs(x) - ans**3
 --> 8 - 0 = 8
 --> 8 - 1**3 = 7
 --> 8 - 2**3 = 0
 Exit loop

This is a Guess and Check algorithm
- Exhaustive Enumeration
- These are Brute Force solutions

Approximation - finding an answer that's good enough
- Find a y s.t. y*y = x + - Epsilon

Bisection search
- Cut search space in half each iteration



Example code

# Find the cube root of x using guess and check
# add abs and if statement in else to account for negative inputs
# x = int(raw_input("Enter an integer: "))
# ans = 0
# while ans**3 < abs(x):
#   ans = ans + 1
# if ans**3 != abs(x):
#   print(str(x) + ' is not a perfect cube')
# else:
#   if x < 0:
#     ans = -ans
#   print('Cube root of ' + str(x) + ' is ' + str(ans)) 


# For loops - another way to use guess and check

# Computing cube root using for loops

# x = int(raw_input("Enter an integer: "))
# # Generate
# for ans in range(0, abs(x)+1):
#   # Test / Check
#   if ans**3 == abs(x):
#     break
# if ans**3 != abs(x):
#   print(str(x) + ' is not a perfect cube')
# else:
#   if x < 0:
#     ans = -ans
#   print("Cube root of" + str(x) + ' is ' + str(ans))


# Approximation methods

# Start with exhaustive enumeration
# take small steps to generate guesses in order
# check to see if close enough

# In general it will take x/step size to get to the solution (so it could take a while)
# x = 25
# epsilon = 0.01 # this is how close we want to get
# step = epsilon**2
# numGuesses = 0
# ans = 0.0
# # Check to see that you haven't gone too far and you're not done with the loop yet
# while (abs(ans**2 - x)) >= epsilon and ans <= x:
#   ans += step
#   numGuesses += 1
# print('numGuesses = ' + str(numGuesses))
# if abs(ans**2-x) >= epsilon:
#   print("Failed on square root of " + str(x))
# else:
#   print(str(ans) + ' is close to the square root of ' + str(x))


# Bisection search

# This is a faster search method than approximation
# At each stage, reduce the range of values you need to search by half

# Example of square root problem
# x = 25
# epsilon = 0.01
# numGuesses = 0
# low = 0.0
# high = x
# # Initial answer is the mid point
# ans = (high + low) / 2.0
# # This is asking 'Am I close enough?'
# while abs(ans**2-x) >= epsilon:
#   print('low = ' + str(low) + ' high ' + str(high) + 'ans = ' + str(ans))
#   numGuesses += 1
#   # If guess was too low, you make that low number into the answer
#   if ans**2 < x:
#     low = ans
#   else:
#     high = ans
#   ans = (high + low)/2.0
# print('numGuesses = ' + str(numGuesses))
# print(str(ans) + ' is close to the square root of ' + str(x))

# This takes significantly fewer steps than the approximation method 


# Newton-Raphson algorithm ( For square root  of k --> g - (g**2 - k) / 2g) ) 

# epsilon = 0.01
# y = 800.0
# guess = y/2.0

# while abs(guess*guess - y) >= epsilon:
#   guess = guess - (((guess**2) - y) / (2 * guess))
#   print(guess)
# print('Square root of ' + str(y) + ' is about ' + str(guess))
