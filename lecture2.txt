Everything is an object

- Scalar and non-scalar objects
- Expressions
- overloaded operators have a meaning that depends upon the type of the operands ( + , -, / )


Program = script
- sequence of commands

Variable is a name for an object
- assignment statement binds a name to an object

Straight line programs
- Every command gets executed once

Conditional statements
- if, else, elif

Programs are intended to be read
- This is so they can be debugged
- And so you can see the structure of your program on the screen

Branching programs
- run time not proportional to lines of code

Straight line programs - run time determined by number of lines of code in the program

Looping construct (iteration)
- Turing complete
- more complicated flow of control


Example code:

##x = 3 
##x = x * x
##print(x)

##y = float(input('Enter a number: '))
##print(y)

##x = int(input('Enter an integer: '))
##if x%2== 0:
##    print('Even')
##else:
##    print('Odd')
##    if x%3 != 0:
##        print('And not divisible by 3')


x = int(input('Enter x: '))
y = int(input('Enter y: '))
z = int(input('Enter z: '))

if x < y:
    if x < z:
        print('x is least')
    else:
        print('z is least')
else:
    print('y is least')

if x < y:
    if x < z:
        print('x is least')
    else:
        print('z is least')
elif y < z:
    print('y is least')
else:
    print('z is least')

if x < y and x < z:
    print('x is least')
elif y < z:
    print('y is least')
